## What is this?

On its own, all what this extension does is add empty image slots to your story.
Use it alongside <a href="https://github.com/lucasshuan/NovelAI_Pixu_Extension">Pixu Browser Extension</a> to have as many images on your stories as you want.

## Known Issues

- Widgets make the screen go flickering when you are all the way scrolled down.
