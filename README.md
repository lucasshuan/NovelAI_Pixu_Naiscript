## What is this?

On its own, all what this script does is add empty image slots to your story.
Use it alongside <a href="https://github.com/lucasshuan/NovelAI_Pixu_Extension">Pixu Browser Extension</a> to have as many images on your stories as you want.

## Known Issues

- Widgets make the screen go flickering when you are all the way scrolled down.
- Sometimes when an widget is added, the story screen is forcefully scrolled to the bottom.
